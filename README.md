# About the project

Since I wanted to improve and put my React JS skills on the next level, I decided to use React JS with Styled Components for this Frontend Mentor challenge. It was a very exciting and challenging experience for me primarily because I didn't want to use vanilla CSS. All the styles I've done using Styled Components and this was roughly my third project in which I used Styled Components, so I'm kinda still new to this. The website is fully responsive from the desktop version (around 1300px) down to 360px (low res mobile phones). If you think something can be improved or could have been coded better way, feel free to let me know.
